Ticketing System for Road Damages
Project Proposal: Ticketing System for Road Damages
Objective:
To develop an AI-powered, citizen-centric platform that revolutionizes road maintenance in Egypt by streamlining the identification, categorization, and resolution of road damages. 'Rafeeq' aims to integrate cutting-edge technologies, including AI and predictive analytics, to enhance government efficiency, improve public safety, and foster active citizen participation in infrastructure development.
Overview:

User Journey:

Citizens use the 'Rafeeq' app to capture road damages and submit reports geotagged with GPS data.
The app employs AI to analyze images and categorize damages by severity.
Users receive real-time updates on the status of their reports.
Government Workflow:

A centralized dashboard provides insights into reported issues using data visualization and analytics.
AI-driven prioritization ensures resources are allocated effectively.
Progress tracking and feedback mechanisms enable transparent operations.
Key Features:

AI-Driven Categorization: AI models assess the severity of road damage and prioritize reports.
Interactive Maps: Real-time visualization of reported issues across Egypt.
Predictive Maintenance Insights: AI predicts future maintenance needs based on historical data.
Citizen Feedback: Users can rate and comment on resolved issues.


Key Features:
1. Damage Reporting & Tracking (3 Weeks):
o Simple interface for users to report road damages with photos, descriptions, and optional videos.
o Input fields for user information, including name, national ID, and contact details.
o Automatic location tagging using GPS.
o Real-time updates on ticket status and repair progress.
o Team Roles: UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer for interface design; Backend Developer for data storage and GPS integration.
2. Automated Routing (2-3 Weeks):
o AI-driven categorization of damage types (e.g., pothole, crack, flooding).
o Automatic routing to the appropriate municipal or private maintenance team based on location and damage type.
o Team Roles: Backend Developer & Frontend Developer for AI routing integration; Software Tester for validation.
3. Feedback Mechanism (1-2 Weeks):
o Citizens can provide feedback and ratings on the repair quality.
o Two-way communication for follow-up queries and concerns.
o Team Roles: UI/UX Designer for feedback module design; Frontend Developer for user interface; Backend Developer for communication features.
4. Analytics & Reporting (1 Week):
o Dashboard for authorities to view damage trends, repair efficiency, and resource allocation.
o Historical data analysis to identify frequently affected areas and optimize repair schedules.
o Team Roles: Backend Developer for data aggregation; Frontend Developer for dashboard UI; Software Tester for dashboard functionality.
5. AI Prioritization (2-3 Weeks):
o Use of machine learning models to prioritize repairs based on factors such as road type, traffic volume, and damage severity.
o Predictive analytics to forecast future road conditions and necessary interventions.
o Team Roles: Backend Developer for AI model integration; Software Tester for model validation.
Scope:
The ticketing system will initially cover major cities and expand to include the New Administrative Capital in Egypt. This ensures the inclusion of rapidly developing urban areas with significant infrastructure needs.
